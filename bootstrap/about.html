                <h1>In The Begining... ðŸ™‚</h1>
                <p>In September of 2002, I became self-employed as a property manager.</p>
                <p>During my first few months, there was multiple times where the same action needed to be repeated over and over
                    in Excel&nbsp;while preparing the end of the month reports for investors. That is when the following question
                    popped up in my thinking.</p>
                <p>Is there a more efficient way to get this done?</p>
                <p>That one question would set into motion a journey into the world of software development. It started with my
                    first script in Visual Basic for Applications. To repeat multiple steps that had to be completed on a monthly
                    basis, thus saving me time and my customers money. It was the beginning of a powerful win-win scenario for
                    myself, and my customers.</p>
                <p>This led me to search out as much information as I could find on the possibilities available to me in the world
                    of programming. What could be accomplished? How hard would it be to learn what I needed to learn to make
                    a significant impact on my efficiency in completing the tasks at hand?</p>
                <p>That led me to completing an Associates of Science in Computer Science through Florida Metropolitan University.
                    Which I finished in September of 2005. However,&nbsp;I didn't realize how much of an impact programming would
                    make on my bottom line in property management. Mix that with the fact that the economy was booming provided
                    me with the ability to grow my self-employment position while at the same time creating freedom to continue
                    my learning in programming.</p>
                <p>Around this time was when QuickBooks Application Programming Interface (API) was brought to my attention. I started
                    developing scripts that not only removed the need for double entry of data from QuickBooks to Excel, but
                    also gave the ability to analyze information in a way that took a large amount of time to do manually prior
                    to this. My mind was opened to the bigger picture in a much more tangible way of what was possible with software
                    development.
                </p>
                <p>The economy took a turn for the worse at this point, and the world of property management felt the effects, although
                    it took a little while for them to be noticed as far as my&nbsp;bottom line on a month to month basis.
                </p>
                <p>That was when I started to think, what do&nbsp;I want to pursue in the future? Do I want to spend my time building
                    a future in property management, or do I want to take my software development skills and use them to get
                    paid to develop software?</p>
                <p>I had an Associates Degree in Computer Science, but so did many other developers. I needed to find a place that
                    could help me take my knowledge and apply it in a way that would bring real world experience to go along
                    with the knowledge that I was gaining. So i began to research.</p>
                <p>My research landed me in the enrollment process at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com" target="_blank">The Tech Academy of Portland Oregon</a>.
                    Which brings me to present day. As I am going through their program, I am creating this site to provide my
                    thoughts on what I am learning. Also, enabling you to get to know me better and get a feel for how what I
                    am learning might be able to benefit you, your company, and the customers that you serve in a positive way.</p>
                <p>With that in mind, please feel free to look over the site as I continue to develop it and take advantage of the
                    information that will be provided. Don't hesitate to visit my <a href="http://justincharris.com/index.php/contact/">contact page</a>&nbsp;and
                    drop me a message with any questions that you might have.</p>
                <p>Here's hoping that the future brings you and your family many blessings and the health to be able to enjoy all
                    those blessings to the fullest!</p>
